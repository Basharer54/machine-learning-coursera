### IMPORTANT NOTES

The class does not officially support `python`. If your goal is to get a certificate, the grades which you get should be based on completing the `Matlab`/`Octave` assignments. The `python` assignments are for learning purpose only.

### Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank professor Andrew Ng and the team of the Stanford Machine Learning class on Coursera for such an awesome course.

- The re-written instructions in `python` starter code embedded within the Jupyter Notebook for submitting assignments for grading is based on [`dibgerge`'s](https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments) `python` submission template of the assignments.
